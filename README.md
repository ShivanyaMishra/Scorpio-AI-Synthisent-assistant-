# 🤖 SCORPIO (AI Synthisent assistant)– Synthisent Core Of Reasoning, Prediction, Intelligence & Optimization

 🧠 Description  
**SCORPIO** We all know what is Virtual Assistant. If you don’t, don’t worry, open your mobile and say “Ok Google” or “Hey Siri”. 
Well, Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa all these are example of Virtual Assistant. Just like that SOCRPIO  is also an Ai SYNTHISENT (Synthetic + Sentient) ASSITANT  
who is the combination of 3D AI VIRTUALL ASSITANT and AI CHATBOT. Scorpio combines a synthetic mind with sentient abilities, offering a smart 3D virtual assistant that goes beyond traditional chatbots. 
Designed for business analysis and predictions, Scorpio learns, adapts, and provides intuitive solutions, making it the perfect partner for decision-making. It’s have a special feature to manage your files automatically.
.it is a Flask-based personal assistant that works both as a **chatbot** and a **voice-interactive tool**. It can answer queries, open websites, perform basic tasks, and respond via text or speech.

The tool is designed to act as a lightweight, offline virtual assistant that can be run locally without heavy setup.
